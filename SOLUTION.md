# Solution: Fixing the MostSearchedCars Component

## The Problem
The `MostSearchedCars` component doesn't properly filter listings based on the `is_public` field because the field is not included in the API response from `/api/most-searched`.

## Root Cause
The console logs show that all car listings have `is_public: undefined` in the API response, even though the database has the field set properly (as seen in your screenshot).

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update the Database Function

The database stored procedure `get_most_viewed_cars` needs to be updated to include the `is_public` field in its return values.

Log into your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor, and execute the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_most_viewed_cars(limit_count integer)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  make text,
  model text,
  year integer,
  price numeric,
  mileage numeric,
  fuel_type text,
  transmission text,
  condition text,
  body_type text,
  exterior_color text,
  interior_color text,
  status text,
  images text[],
  created_at timestamp with time zone,
  view_count bigint,
  seller_name text,
  location_city text,
  location_country text,
  is_public boolean   -- Added is_public field
) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    cl.id,
    cl.make,
    cl.model,
    cl.year,
    cl.price,
    cl.mileage,
    cl.fuel_type,
    cl.transmission,
    cl.condition,
    cl.body_type,
    cl.exterior_color,
    cl.interior_color,
    cl.status,
    cl.images,
    cl.created_at,
    COALESCE(lv.count, 0)::bigint AS view_count,
    cl.seller_name,
    cl.location_city,
    cl.location_country,
    cl.is_public    -- Include is_public in the returned data
  FROM
    car_listings cl
  LEFT JOIN
    listing_views lv ON cl.id = lv.listing_id
  WHERE
    cl.status = 'available'
  ORDER BY
    view_count DESC, cl.created_at DESC
  LIMIT limit_count;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 2. Update the API Endpoint

Modify the API endpoint to filter by `is_public` in `src/app/api/most-searched/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Filter on API side to avoid returning deleted or sold cars
const filteredCars = (data || []).filter(car =>
    car &&
    car.id &&
    car.make &&
    car.model &&
    car.year &&
    car.status &&
    car.status.toLowerCase() === 'available' &&
    // Only include cars that are explicitly public
    (car as any).is_public === true
);
```

### 3. Wait for Changes to Take Effect

Once you've made these changes:
1. Restart your server
2. Make a request to the Most Searched Cars page
3. Check the console to verify that the `is_public` field is now included in the API response

### 4. Keep the Frontend Protection

The current frontend code in `MostSearchedCars.tsx` and `MostSearchedCarsClient.tsx` is already well-prepared to handle the `is_public` field, so no further changes are needed there.

### Result

After these changes, the component will only display listings where `is_public = TRUE`.
